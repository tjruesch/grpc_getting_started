# grpc_getting_started

Small demo project for getting startet with [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) and [Go](https://golang.org/).

Read the mini series on medium.com to get started with gRPC APIs in Go:

- Part 1: [Getting Started with gRPC and Golang](https://medium.com/@tj.ruesch/getting-started-with-grpc-and-golang-45407211f04d)
- Part 2: [Your first gRPC API in Golang](https://medium.com/@tj.ruesch/your-first-grpc-api-in-golang-d277d684b84e)

*Note:* To actually be able to translate stuff with this API you will need an API Key from [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/pro-api?cta=header-pro-api/) and/or [Google](https://cloud.google.com/translate). Both offer free versions of their APIs.
